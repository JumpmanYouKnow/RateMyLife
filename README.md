Rate My Life - FinHacks

##Description
Our project "RateMyLife" is committed to build a better financial and healthy world to our customers. Our primary concept is if a person has a good lifestyle(driving habit), then his life risk is relatively lower, thus he deserves a lower quote. For those who don't have a good lifestyle, we can lead them to a good lifestyle by giving them financial incentives.
Based on the searches, most of the millienials don't have lifeinsurance. We believe our product could not only help insurance companies attract more custmoer, but also get customers' life more healthy, more insured.
We have built both an IOS application and a Web page. Based on the concept and technology of IOT, we design our application to track our costumers' daily life: tracking their driving, sleep and dietary habit. By doing so, we generate ratings as a judgement to our customers' daily life.

##Instruction
Our web server site : http://ratemylife.tk/

On the customer side, they should have access to at least mobile phones in order to get full usage of our app. In order to get the most accurate, customized scores will be generated and eligible for sending to insurance companies after one week's use of info-tracking.
On the company side, registered insurance companies will have access to our rating database, for pricing purposes only. If a greater score has appeared in our database and stayed consistent for a short period of time, we will inform the insurance companies to confirm a price drop in premium, and vice versa.
